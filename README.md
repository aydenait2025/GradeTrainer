GradeTrainer is a web-based platform designed for educational scenarios to train AI grading models. It allows educators to easily upload historical assignments along with their corresponding grades, and automatically fine-tune open-source large language models (e.g., LLaMA2-Chat or StarCoder) to create high-accuracy grading models—no programming experience required. After training, users can monitor progress, view validation results, and download or deploy the fine-tuned model for automated grading or integration with multi-agent AI systems.

Key Features

Historical Assignment Upload: Support for folder or ZIP uploads; automatically parses student submissions and grade data.

Training Parameter Adjustment: Customize training epochs, batch size, learning rate, model selection, FP16 / quantization options.

Automated Fine-Tuning: Uses GPU server to perform LoRA/PEFT fine-tuning on open-source LLMs without manual intervention.

Real-Time Training Monitoring: Track logs, loss, and validation accuracy during training.

Training Results Export: Download the fine-tuned model or deploy it directly as an API for integration with grading systems.

Zero Programming Required: Teachers can train and manage models entirely through the web interface.

Use Cases

Universities or educational institutions looking to build AI grading models quickly.

Grading programming assignments, essays, or subjective questions automatically.

Integration with multi-agent AI systems for fully autonomous grading and feedback.

GradeTrainer makes AI grading model training simple, visual, and efficient, providing educators with a powerful tool to enhance intelligent education.
